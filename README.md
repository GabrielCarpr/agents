# Agents

This repo contains my person AI agent infrastructure. This should be patched into the `~/.config/opencode` directory. It can then be symlinked to ~/.agents, so that it will interoperate with Codex and Claude.

Within it, is symlinks skills with opencode agents, again for interoperability.
